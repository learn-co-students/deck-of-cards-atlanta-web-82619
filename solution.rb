# Construct a class for a Deck of cards, which has an attribute cards 
# consisting of an array of 52 Card objects.
# A Card consists of a rank ("A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K") 
# paired with a suit ("Hearts", "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Spades")
# Your Deck should have a method #choose_card which selects a random card from the deck and removes it.
